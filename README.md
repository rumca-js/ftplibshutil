# This is ftp shutil like functionality

Installing this using python3 setup tools works. Requires root priviliges.
```
python3 setup.py install
```

# API
Can be observed using examples/down.py. Provides FTPShutil class with the following methods:
 - download_dir
 - upload_dir
 - quit
We can add more later on.

# Other

You can try installing this using pip. I have not checked if that works.
```
pip install git+https://github.com/rumca-js/ftplibshutil.git#egg=ftpshutil-renegat0x0
```
